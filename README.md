# Music-Player.github.io

Hii, I am Harsh , this is the major Project of my Coding Ninja's Front-End Web. Development course and In this project my main Aim is to make Homepage  for a Online Music PLayer website like Spotify but only Using only HTML and CSS (can latter use JS on it but Not for now).

Main Homepage of the website is index.html and styling for the this html is done by external css called stylesheet.css and  there is one more css files which is to make the pages more responsive and all the media(images) required for these pages are in the "media.zip" you need to extract this file.
